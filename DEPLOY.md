# How to Deploy Changes

```bash
cd C:\Users\kmedv\OneDrive\github\darko\darko-site
git add .
git commit -m "description of what you changed"
git push
```

Vercel auto-redeploys in ~30 seconds. That's it.

If you want to preview changes before pushing, run `npm run dev` and check `localhost:5173` first.
